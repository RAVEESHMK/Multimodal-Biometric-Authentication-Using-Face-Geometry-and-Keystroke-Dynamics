# Multimodal-Biometric-Authentication-Using-Face-Geometry-and-Keystroke-Dynamics
we designed a multimodal system that integrates face geometry and keystroke dynamics. The face modality provides a physiological signal based on the spatial arrangement of facial landmarks, while keystrokes offer behavioral patterns derived from typing rhythms.
