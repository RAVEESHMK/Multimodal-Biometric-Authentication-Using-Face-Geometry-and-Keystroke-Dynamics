Multimodal Biometric Authentication

This project implements a multimodal biometric authentication system using face landmarks and keystroke dynamics. The goal is to compare unimodal and fused systems and evaluate how different keystroke feature representations affect performance.

This code was developed for the CAP6101 Multimodal Biometrics Project.

1. Requirements

Install the needed libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


Tested with Python 3.11 on a standard CPU.

2. Project Files
data_loading.py         # Dataset loading + user alignment
features.py             # Statistical & PCA keystroke features
matching_and_fusion.py  # Template/query splits, scoring, fusion
main.py                 # Evaluator (EER, d', ROC, DET, score plots)
project_experiments.py  # Runs RQ1 & RQ2 experiments


Place these data files in the same folder:

face_features.npy
face_labels.npy
keystroke_features.csv

3. How to Run the Project

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

python project_experiments.py


This will automatically:

Load face + keystroke data

Run RQ1 (unimodal vs fusion)

Run RQ2 (stats vs PCA features)

Generate all ROC, DET, and score distribution plots

Print performance summaries (d′ and EER)

All plots are saved as .png files in the same directory.

4. Expected Output

After running the script, you will see:

Printed summaries for each system (face-only, keystroke-only, fused, etc.)

Plots automatically saved:

roc_curve_system_*.png

det_curve_system_*.png

score_distribution_system_*.png

These can be inserted directly into your project report and presentation.

5. Troubleshooting

Missing library errors:
Install required packages with

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


File not found:
Ensure the .npy face files and keystroke .csv file are in the same directory as the code.

6. Summary

This project provides a complete, reproducible pipeline for multimodal biometric authentication using face geometry and keystroke timing signals. The code is fully modular and ready for experimentation or extension.
